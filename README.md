# ATM_Administration

I have created a basic code for ATM with my knowledge of Python using vs-code.

In this Code, you can view your account balance, withdraw money and add money to your account.

Even the admin can view the account balance. 

There are three files for this programme.

main.py: This is the main entry point of the ATM system. It likely redirects to either user.py for user interactions or admin.py for admin actions. 

user.py: This module seems to handle user interactions with the ATM system. Users can check their balance, withdraw, and insert money into their accounts through this module.

admin.py: This module provides admin-specific functionalities. Admins can likely view account balances by entering an admin PIN and account number.

Both files have their unique authentication process.

The users have to use their account number and their unique pin number.

The admin must use the admin login ID and their  pin number.
